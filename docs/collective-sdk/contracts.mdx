# Contracts

[See source implementation here](https://github.com/liquality/Collective-Protocol).

## Collective Contract

This contract is the main entry point for the Collective. It implements core collective functionalities and also includes a minimal AA (Account Abstraction) account.

### Function Specifications

`initialize(address theInitiator, address theOperator, address theFactory)`
Initializes the contract with the following parameters:

`theInitiator`: The address of the initiator (creator) of the Collective.
`theOperator`: The address of the operator (manager) of the Collective.
`theFactory`: The address of the factory contract that created this Collective.

This function sets the initial values for operator, initiator, collectiveFactory, and adds the initiator as the first member of the Collective.

`setWallet(address theWallet)`
Sets the address of the Collective's wallet (cWallet) to the provided theWallet address. This function can only be called by the collectiveFactory contract.

`joinCollective(bytes calldata _inviteSig, bytes16 _inviteId)`
Allows a new member to join the Collective by providing a valid invitation signature (\_inviteSig) and invitation ID (\_inviteId). The function verifies the signature and the signer's membership before adding the new member to the Collective.

`leaveCollective()`
Allows a member to leave the Collective by removing their membership.

`removeMember(address _member)`
Allows the initiator to remove a member from the Collective.

`createPools(address[] calldata _tokenContracts, address[] calldata _honeyPots)`
Allows a member to create new pools by providing an array of token contract addresses (\_tokenContracts) and an array of corresponding "honeyPot" addresses (\_honeyPots). The function deploys a new Pool contract for each pair of token contract and honeyPot address, and whitelists the necessary addresses in the Collective's wallet.

`recordPoolMint(address _pool, address _participant, uint256 _tokenID, uint256 _quantity, uint256 _amountPaid)`
Records a mint event in the specified \_pool for the given \_participant, \_tokenID, \_quantity, and \_amountPaid. This function can only be called by the Collective's wallet (cWallet).

`receivePoolReward(address _honeyPot)`
Receives a reward for the pool associated with the provided \_honeyPot address. The function forwards the received ETH to the corresponding pool contract and emits a RewardForwarded event.

`renounceOperator()`
Allows the current operator to renounce their role as the operator of the Collective.

`whitelistTargets(address[] calldata _targets)`
Allows the operator to whitelist an array of target addresses in the Collective's wallet.

`blacklistTargets(address[] calldata _targets)`
Allows the operator to blacklist an array of target addresses in the Collective's wallet.
Internal Functions

`_requireFromMembers(address caller)`:
Internal function to check if the caller is a member of the Collective.

`_requireFromInitiator()`:
Internal function to check if the caller is the initiator of the Collective.

`_requireFromAuthorizedOperator()`:
Internal function to check if the caller is the authorized operator of the Collective.

`getCaller(): `
Internal function to retrieve the actual caller address, handling the case where the call is made through the Collective's wallet (cWallet).

`recoverSigner(bytes calldata _inviteSig, bytes16 _inviteId)`
Internal function to recover the signer address from the provided invitation signature (\_inviteSig) and invitation ID (\_inviteId).

### Factory addresses and Supported Chains

If you want to create your own collective, you can deploy them using one of the following factory addresses
