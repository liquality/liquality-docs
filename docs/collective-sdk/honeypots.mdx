# Honeypots

[See source implementation here](https://github.com/liquality/my-collectives-sdk/blob/main/src/honeyPots/index.ts).

The Honeypot Contract are where all the rewards are sent to. For example, on Zora mints,
creators could set the rewards address or a splitter address as the honeypot address. Rewards would automatically be distributed to the honeypot which can later be used for the collective.

:::info Automatic Distribution
If you do not have automatic rewards distribution in your app or contract, you may want to consider sending the reward to the honeypot manually.

# Create

### Create a honeypot

```typescript
    public static async create(caller: ethers5.providers.Web3Provider, salt : ethers.BigNumberish)
```

# Get

### Get a honeypot

```typescript
public static async get(caller: ethers5.providers.Web3Provider, salt : ethers.BigNumberish)
```

Example use of getting and creating a honeypot:

```typescript
  async createHoneyPot() {
    this.initSDKConfig();
    const provider = await this.getProvider();
    const salt = generateSalt();
    const createResponse = await MyCollectives.HoneyPot.create(provider, salt);
    const response = await MyCollectives.HoneyPot.get(provider, salt);
    console.log("!!!!! response honey pot address => ", response);
    return response;
  },
```

# Top Contributor

### Set top contributor for a honeypot/collective

```typescript
public static async setTopContributor(privateKey: string, honeyPotAddress: string, topContributor: string): Promise<TransactionResponse>
```

Example usage:

```typescript
const honeyPotHasBalance = await RewardsService.getHoneyPotContractBalance(pool.honeyPotAddress);
if (honeyPotHasBalance.balanceInEth || 0) > 0) {
  const setTopContributorResponse =
    await MyCollectives.HoneyPot.setTopContributor(
      privateKey,
      pool.honeyPotAddress,
      topContributorAddress.address
    );
}
```

### Get top contributor

Can be used to get top contributor or check if top contributor has been set

```typescript
public static async getTopContributor(honeyPotAddress: string)
```

# Send Reward

### Send the reward to the honeypot

```typescript
public static async sendReward(privateKey: string,  honeyPotAddress: string)
```
