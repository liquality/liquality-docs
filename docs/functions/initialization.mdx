# Initialization

---

## Install

You can use npm or yarn to install the Liquality SDK

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @liquality-sdk
```

## Service Provider Setup

The seamless login experience with social single-sign-on is dependent on the service worker which need to be registered in the project.

## Webpack and Dependency Issues

If you are setting up a new web3 project from scratch, chances are likely you will have some dependency
issues that need polyfilling. This is because web3.js and ether.js that work with the Liquality SDK
under the hood have certain dependencies which are not present within the browser environment by webpack 5.
That is why you need to polyfill certain modules in your project to override and enable their usage.

---

## React Polyfilling

If you are using `create-react-app` version >= 5 you may run into issues building and the project complaining about certain modules. You can resolve it by polyfilling.

- Install `react-app-rewired` and the missing modules into your application

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev react-app-rewired crypto-browserify stream-browserify assert stream-http https-browserify os-browserify url buffer process
```

Then create a file called `config-overrides.js` in the root folder with the following content:

```js
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = function override(config) {
  const fallback = config.resolve.fallback || {};
  Object.assign(fallback, {
    crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
    stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
    assert: require.resolve("assert"),
    http: require.resolve("stream-http"),
    https: require.resolve("https-browserify"),
    os: require.resolve("os-browserify"),
    url: require.resolve("url"),
  });
  config.resolve.fallback = fallback;
  config.plugins = (config.plugins || []).concat([
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      process: "process/browser",
      Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"],
    }),
  ]);
  config.ignoreWarnings = [/Failed to parse source map/];
  config.module.rules.push({
    test: /\.(js|mjs|jsx)$/,
    enforce: "pre",
    loader: require.resolve("source-map-loader"),
    resolve: {
      fullySpecified: false,
    },
  });
  return config;
};
```

- Within the `package.json` file in the root project, you also need to change the scripts field for start, build and test.
  Instead of `react-scripts` replace it with `react-app-rewired`

<Tabs
  defaultValue="after"
  values={[
    { label: "before", value: "before" },
    { label: "after", value: "after" },
]}
>

<TabItem value="before">

```typescript
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="after">

```typescript
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-app-rewired start",
    "build": "react-app-rewired build",
    "test": "react-app-rewired test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
