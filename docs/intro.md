# Introduction

Our goal is to allow developers to easily integrate with wallets, where the wallet becomes as invisible as possible to the user but remains non custodial if/when the user requires full control.

We have built our wallet libraries to be fully self-custodial, extensible so others can build on top (i.e. LiFi, DeBridge, and others have already integrated into them) and multi chain / chain agnostic from the start. We will become the underlying infrastructure for in-app wallets, and are building a self-custodial, extensible, censorship-resistant wallet API network on top of our existing wallet libraries.
