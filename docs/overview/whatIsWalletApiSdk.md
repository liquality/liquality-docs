# What is the wallet API/SDK ?

---

Wallet integration is one of the most significant use cases for the Liquality API and SDK. Our SDK development suite is not a wallet itself but rather provides wallet and development infrastructure for blockchain interactions. A standard cryptographic key provider unique to the user and application is produced by the SDK. You can sign transactions, messages, and many other wallet iteractions with this key provider.
