# What is the web3 wallet API/SDK ?

---

Liquality provides the first self-custodial wallet-as-a-service platform to help build immersive, seamless, and customizable gaming or app experiences. The invisible web3 wallet platform is easy to integrate and will cut your time to launch to a minimum.

The wallet API and SDK provide all the necessary tools and resources to include customized wallets into your web3 game or application. It allows for quick integration into an existing product or platform, giving your users the power to securely store, send, and receive digital assets.

The SDK simplifies the setup process, and provides detailed documentation, tutorials and offers a secure and robust framework for integrating custom wallets.

Our goal is to allow developers to easily integrate frictionless, fully immersive web3 wallets, enabling you to give your users full control over their assets.
