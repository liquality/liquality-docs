# What is the wallet API/SDK ?

---

Liquality provides the first self-custodial wallet-as-a-service platform to help build immersive, seamless, and customizable gaming, NFT, or web3 project experiences. The invisible web3 wallet infrastructure will make it possible to go live in a very short time frame.

A wallet API and SDK provides the necessary tools and resources that are needed to implement customized wallets in a web3 game or application. It allows for quick integration into an their existing product or platform, giving them the opportunity to securely store, send, and receive digital assets.

The SDK simplifies the setup process, provides detailed documentation and tutorials and offers a secure and robust framework for building custom wallets.

Our goal is to allow developers to easily integrate frictionless, fully immersive with wallets, where the wallet becomes as invisible as possible to the user but remains non-custodial if/when the user requires full control.
