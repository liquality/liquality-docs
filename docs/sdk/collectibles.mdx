# Collectibles & NFTs

The Liquality NFT API can manage collections of standardized NFTs (ERC-721, and ERC-1155) on multiple chains (atm: Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Arbitrum).

The user gets easy access to NFTs and is able to send, receive, and check stats.

Data sources are delivered by providers (Moralis: Ethereum, Polygon, Solana; Covalent 2: Arbitrum). The data provider will deliver the image (otherwise placeholder), NFT name, NFT description, token ID, creator, creator fee, locked, collection description, account address, asset contract, token standard, and the number of copies owned if ERC-1155 is available.

---

## Receive NFTs

The user will automatically receive the NFTs by injection in regard to the account address provided and then shown in the generalized NFT area (regardless of account), or in the account's first position. The detection of the NFTs happens automatically.

## View NFTs from specific address and chain

```typescript
const nfts = await getNfts(owner: string, chainID: number): Promise<Nft[] | null>
```

Parameters:

| Name    | Type   | Description                                         |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| owner   | string | address of the wallet you want to get all nfts from |
| chainID | number | which chain you want to get all NFTs from           |

<br></br>

:::tip You can check the chainID for all chains
like Polygon, Arbitrum, Solana, Ethereum etc.. using https://chainlist.org/

The chainID for Ethereum Mainnet is 1

Return values:

```typescript
export interface Nft {
  id: string;
  contract: {
    address: string;
    name?: string;
    symbol?: string;
    type?: NftType;
  };
  metadata?: {
    name?: string;
    description?: string;
    image?: string;
  };
  balance?: number;
}
```

## Transfer and Send NFT

```typescript
 await transferNft(
    transferRequest: TransferRequest,
    chainId: number,
    pk: string,
  ): Promise<string>
```

Paramters:

| Name            | Type            | Description                          |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| transferRequest | TransferRequest | ...more to come                      |
| chainID         | number          | which chain you want to send to      |
| pk              | string          | users privateKey to sign transaction |

```javascript
export interface TransferRequest {
  contractAddress: string;
  owner: string;
  receiver: string;
  tokenIDs: string[];
  amounts?: number[];
}
```

Return values:

| Name   | Type   | Description           |
| ------ | ------ | --------------------- |
| txHash | string | transaction hash (id) |

Users can send a single NFT (or copy) to another address with enough funds to cover blockchains' speed/fee with out-of-the-box validation and error handling.
:::tip
Once the tx is initiated the progress will be tracked (pending vs. completed) and shown to the user with an activity log as well tx details.

## View NFTs by account

```javascript
wallet.getters.accountNftCollections(accountId);
```

## Get Marketplace Name

Every NFT is in correlation with a marketplace and can be linked to (OpenSea: Ethereum, Polygon, Stratos: Arbitrum, MagicEden: Solana).

```javascript
getMarketplaceName(asset: Asset, network: Network)
```

Return values:

| Name | Type   | Description          |
| ---- | ------ | -------------------- |
| name | string | Nft marketplace name |

## Get NFT Transfer Link

```javascript
export const getNftTransferLink = (asset: Asset, network: Network, tokenId: string, contract_address: string)

```

Return values:

| Name | Type   | Description                     |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| link | string | Nft transfer link (marketplace) |

## Mark as Favourite

An NFT can be marked as a favorite by a user/wallet, and that attribute is added to the NFT.

```javascript
await toggleNFTStarred({
  network: activeNetwork,
  walletId: activeWalletId,
  accountId: nftAsset.accountId,
  nft: nftAsset,
});
```

## Sort by favorite NFT within a collection

:::info
Marked as favorite NFTs will be placed on top of the collection, so the user can have the favorites faster in sight.
