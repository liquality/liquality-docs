# Gasless Transactions

The Liquality SDK provides the capability of executing gasless transactions across a range of functions. It is using the [Gelato Relayer](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay/what-is-relaying) under the hood.

Presently, the gasless experience is supported by the following functions:
---


* swap
* transfer
* transferNft
* mintERC1155Token
* mintERC721Token
* createERC1155Collection
* createERC721Collection
