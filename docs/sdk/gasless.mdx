# Gasless Transactions

The Liquality SDK provides the capability of executing gasless transactions across a range of functions. It is using the [Gelato Relayer](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay/what-is-relaying) under the hood.

Presently, the gasless experience is supported by the following functions:


---


* swap
* transfer
* transferNft
* mintERC1155Token
* mintERC721Token
* createERC1155Collection
* createERC721Collection

To be able to use the gasless functionalities, you first need to generate a Gelato API key. Go to the Gelato app and create an account. 
[Follow this link to set up your Gelato account.](https://relay.gelato.network/apps)

For more info and context on how it works see the [Gelato Docs.](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay)
