## Update Balances

The update of the balance(s) is triggered by
loading,
automatic intervals, or
if initiated by user.

```javascript
await updateBalances({
  network: activeNetwork,
  walletId: activeWalletId,
  accountIds,
});
```

## Receive token(s)

Based on the account address/WalletID (alternatively unstoppable domains) the user is able to transfer tokens/funds into the wallet.
NFTs (ERC-721, or ERC-1155) will be automatically detected, and added to the wallet, based on account address.

## Buy tokens with FIAT on-ramper

Coming soon...

Another option to fund the wallet is to purchase cryptocurrencies (or paying gas/transaction fees) with credit or debit card, and other options like Apple Pay, Google Pay, or SEPA transfer, based on availability and settings. Currently supported providers are Transak and Onramper.

Your region will determine which on-ramp provider is available. Further the available tokens can be specified.

:::caution
Please note that the service involves a KYC-process which will need to be completed outside of the wallet SDK.
